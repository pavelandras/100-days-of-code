# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Pavel Andras

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on March 3, Tuesday, 2020.

## R1D1

Today I finished Tribute Page project (https://codepen.io/pavelandras/pen/QWbMdNe) and Survey Form (https://codepen.io/pavelandras/pen/VwLzWVE) on FreeCodeCamp. Solved some JS Kata on Codewars and also refactored some of my old solutions.

## R1D2

Had a very busy day, so I had time only for practicing and refactoring on Codewars. Also practiced JS regexp a bit.
